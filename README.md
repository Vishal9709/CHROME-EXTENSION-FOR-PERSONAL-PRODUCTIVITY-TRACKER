The Chrome Extension for Personal Productivity Tracker is a powerful, lightweight tool designed to help individuals monitor, analyze, and improve their daily work habits directly within the browser. This extension seamlessly tracks the time you spend on various websites and categorizes them into productive, neutral, or distracting activities based on customizable settings. It offers real-time insights into your online behavior, allowing you to understand where your time goes throughout the day.

With features like daily/weekly reports, goal setting, reminders, and focus mode, the extension encourages mindful browsing and better time management. You can set productivity goals, receive alerts when spending too long on distracting sites, and visualize trends through intuitive charts and graphs.

Privacy is a key focus — all data remains stored locally or encrypted, ensuring your browsing habits remain private. Whether you're a student, freelancer, remote worker, or digital professional, this extension is your personal accountability partner for achieving focus and efficiency online.

By providing actionable insights and helping eliminate distractions, the Personal Productivity Tracker empowers users to make intentional choices and build healthier digital habits — leading to increased productivity, better time utilization, and a more balanced digital lifestyle.
